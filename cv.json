As a consequence, the study of networks and the algorithmic complexity of problems about networks are an increasingly important part of the application of mathematics to practical problems. The content of this dissertation explores a variety of topics on this theme. First, we explore the tractibility of computing certain kinds of equilibria for anticoordination games played on graphs. Next, we study a generic notion of “resilience” for combinatorial search problems, specifically studying the complexity of resilient graph coloring. Then we turn to the study of MapReduce, a popular distributed computing framework whose crucial open questions are about its capacity to solve certain graph problems. Finally, we study a model of disaster recovery in networks, and prove results about the inability for algorithms to compute approximate solutions.",

We show that constant-round MRC computations can decide regular languages and simulate sublogarithmic space-bounded Turing machines. In addition, we prove hierarchy theorems for MRC under certain complexity-theoretic assumptions. These theorems show that sufficiently increasing the number of rounds or the amount of time per processor strictly increases the computational power of MRC. Our work lays the foundation for further analysis relating MapReduce to established complexity classes.

In particular we show that this problem is NP-hard even when restricted to convex decreasing cost functions, give a linear approximation lower bound for the greedy algorithm, and prove a general sub-constant approximation lower bound. Then we give a new integer programming formulation of NANIP and empirically observe its speedup over the original integer programme.",

A central tenet of this problem is relational learning. Here the objective is to incorporate the partial information each data source gives us in a way that captures the true underlying relationships. To address this challenge, we present a general, boosting-inspired framework for combining weak evidence of entity associations into a robust similarity metric. We explore the extent to which different quality measurements yield graph representations that are suitable for community detection. We then present empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrating the utility of this framework. Our framework leads to suitable global graph representations from quality measurements local to each edge. Finally, we discuss future extensions and theoretical considerations of learning useful graph representations from weak feedback in general application settings.",

We characterize the cases when such colorings exist and when the decision problem is NP-hard.

We further consider the directed case, a generalization that captures both coordination and anti-coordination. We prove the decision problem for non-strict equilibria in directed graphs is NP-hard. Our notions also have multiple connections to other combinatorial questions, and our results resolve some open problems in these areas, most notably the complexity of the strictly unfriendly partition problem.",

Our goal is to maintain the high accuracy of these learning algorithms while reducing the degree to which they discriminate against individuals because of their membership in a protected group. Our first contribution is a method for achieving fairness by shifting the decision boundary for the protected group. The method is based on the theory of margins for boosting. We empirically compare our method with other variants of these learning algorithms as well as results in previous papers in the fairness literature. Our method, in addition to outperforming many of the prior algorithms in terms of accuracy and low discrimination, also allows for a fast and transparent quantification of the trade-off between bias and error. Our second contribution addresses the shortcomings of the bias-error trade-off studied in most of the algorithmic fairness literature. We demonstrate that even hopelessly naive modifications of a biased algorithm, which cannot be reasonably said to be 'fair,' can still achieve low bias and high accuracy. To help to distinguish between these naive algorithms and more sensible algorithms we propose a new measure of fairness, called resilience to random bias (RRB). We demonstrate that RRB distinguishes well between our naive and sensible fairness algorithms. RRB together with bias and accuracy provides a more complete picture of the fairness of an algorithm.",

With respect to routing networks, route hijacking has highlighted the need to reexamine the existing protocols that govern traffic routing. In particular, our pri- mary question is how the topology of a network affects the susceptibility of a routing protocol to endogenous route misdirection. In this paper we define and analyze an abstract model of traffic interception (i.e. eavesdropping) in distance-vector routing networks. Specifically, we study al- gorithms that measure the potential of groups of dishonest agents to divert traffic through their infrastructure under the constraint that messages must reach their intended destinations. We relate two variants of our model based on the allowed kinds of lies, define strategies for colluding agents, and prove optimality in special cases. In our main theorem we derive a provably optimal monitoring strategy for subsets of agents in which no two are adjacent, and we extend this strategy to the general case. Finally, we use our results to analyze the susceptibility of real and synthetic networks to endogenous traffic interception. In the Autonomous Systems (AS) graph of the United States, we show that compromising only 18 random nodes in the AS graph surprisingly captures 10% of all traffic paths in the network in expectation when a distance-vector routing protocol is in use.",

We prove lower bounds on the NP-hardness of coloring resiliently colorable graphs, and provide an algorithm that colors sufficiently resilient graphs.
