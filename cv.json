We empirically evaluate the bias and error of four variants of AdaBoost relative to an unmodified AdaBoost baseline, and study the trade-offs between reducing bias and maintaining low error. We further define a new notion of fairness and measure it for all of our methods. Our proposed method, modifying the hypothesis output by AdaBoost by shifting the decision boundary for the protected group, outperforms the state of the art for the census dataset.",

A central tenet of this problem is relational learning. Here the objective is to incorporate the partial information each data source gives us in a way that captures the true underlying relationships. To address this challenge, we present a general, boosting-inspired framework for combining weak evidence of entity associations into a robust similarity metric. We explore the extent to which different quality measurements yield graph representations that are suitable for community detection. We then present empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrating the utility of this framework. Our framework leads to suitable global graph representations from quality measurements local to each edge. Finally, we discuss future extensions and theoretical considerations of learning useful graph representations from weak feedback in general application settings.",

We characterize the cases when such colorings exist and when the decision problem is NP-hard. These correspond to finding pure strategy equilibria in the anti-coordination games, whose price of anarchy we also analyze. We further consider the directed case, a generalization that captures both coordination and anti-coordination. We prove the decision problem for non-strict equilibria in directed graphs is NP-hard. Our notions also have multiple connections to other combinatorial questions, and our results resolve some open problems in these areas, most notably the complexity of the strictly unfriendly partition problem.",

In particular, we study $r$-resiliently $k$-colorable graphs, which are those $k$-colorable graphs that remain $k$-colorable even after the addition of any $r$ new edges. We prove lower bounds on the NP-hardness of coloring resiliently colorable graphs, and provide an algorithm that colors sufficiently resilient graphs. We also analyze the corresponding notion of resilience for $k$-SAT. This notion of resilience suggests an array of open questions for graph coloring and other combinatorial problems.",
